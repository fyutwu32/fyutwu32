This is my first repository about me.

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @fyutwu32
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in chess (any strategy board games :D), Math Olympiad, logic, and coding (obviously).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML. I might create my very first website. Although I created many other websites, they are all inactive and not made by coding.


In this repository, I am doing the best I could of making a short minigame in HTML. If you are an expert or a professional in HTML, please give me tips! Anyone is welcome to make edits, but do not tell everyone it is yours. 
I am learning HTML with w3schools. I have decided that I am good enough to start sharing my codes to others. I hope you enjoy them.
Good morning/noon/night, everyone! Thank you for spending your time on reading this.
